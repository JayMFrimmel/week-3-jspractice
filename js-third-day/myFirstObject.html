<!-- With a partner, spend the next few moments studying the code just slacked to you. 

* Fill in the missing comments to log the relevant information about the provided `car` object.

* Bonus: If you finish early, begin creating an object of your own in HTML. Slack out a snippet of the code to the class when you are done. Be Creative! -->
